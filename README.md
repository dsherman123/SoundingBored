# SoundingBored
SoundingBored is an emotional support tool into a deeply personal journaling SaaS platform that bridges therapeutic insights and human connection. 
It doesn’t compete with therapy—it fills the quiet space between sessions or for those without access.
It can start as a soft place to land—and grow into a quiet revolution in emotional resilience.
